<BODY>
This package and its sub-packages define constraints 
(mathematical relations over variables).

<P>Constraints encapsulate filtering algorithms 
(the algorithm layer of Koalog Constraint Solver).

<P>This package also contain constraint schedulers. 
Constraint schedulers are responsible for scheduling the constraint to be filtered.
